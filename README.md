##Coding Projects

**Why making this project?**
I had experience doing 3.js project, so I decided to use 3.js as my project library.

**The challenge**
The previous project I made was based on a .obj model make by cinema 4D software. Then import the 3D model into an HTML website to demonstrate the model. For this time I try not to use a 3D modelling software and only use the code itself to create the model.
Also, I want to bring a strong visual impact on the audience.

**Inspiration**
My inspiration comes from the space travelling scene from science fiction films. Which could shock the audience and let the audience feeling different.

**Coding**
The source code is the example from class: the cube with sunflowers. Based on this code, I create a group 3D model using a for() loop containing 1500 cubes. Then Rotate the model using sin wave and cos wave. And lastly, I let the camera facing the centre point, and move the camera rapidly (also using sin wave).

**Things could be improved**
I hope I could add a mouse controlling function to let the mouse controlling the angle of view.  Also, if the computer is fast enough, I wish every cube could move on its own so that the frame could be more shocking.
